# GSC Mapvote
GSC mapvote system for Call of Duty: Black Ops II.

* Does not use map shaders, only server text to display map names (mp_raid for ex.).
* Mapvote only executes on the first round of the match.
* Players are only allowed to vote if they spawn during prematch, not if they join mid-game.
* Map automatically changes at the end of killcam.

## Notes
* Tested on a CFW PlayStation 3.
* Developed using personal tools but the `scripts` directory should compile in GSC Studio.
